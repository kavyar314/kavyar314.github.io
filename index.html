Hello! I am a fifth-year PhD student at TTIC, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~avrim/"> Avrim Blum</a>. I have also worked with <a href="https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~nati/"> Nati Srebro</a>. At TTIC, my work has focused on algorithmic decision-making in social problems and understanding theoretical problems that emerge with machine learning at scale related to data and deep learning theory. In summer 2022, I was a participant at the Les Houches summer school on Statistical Physics and Machine Learning. Before TTIC, I completed my SB and MEng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, where I worked with Professor <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/"> Ronitt Rubinfeld</a> on distribution testing. My interests are in algorithms and learning theory, with a focus on interactions between social / human systems and algorithmic ones. In the past, I've worked on medical imaging and pose estimation, and in almost a previous life, nanoparticle-based drug delivery.

<br> <br>

Outside of research, I care a lot about getting more people excited about math and computer science, most recently by facilitating a Girls Who Code club at Chicago Public Library. I was also one of the TTIC student body representatives for 2023-24, a role in which we advocated for students and hosted social events to help foster a sense of community.
